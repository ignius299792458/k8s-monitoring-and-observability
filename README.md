# **`Kubernetes Monitoring and Observability`** 

---

# 🚀 Big Picture First:  
**What is Kubernetes Monitoring and Observability?**  
- **Monitoring** → Collecting `metrics` data from Kubernetes components (pods, nodes, clusters) to check if they are healthy.
- **Logging** → Capturing `logs` generated by apps and cluster components.
- **Tracing** → `Tracking` a single request across services (useful for microservices).
- **Alerting** → Automatically `notifying` when things go wrong.
- **Visualization** → Showing data (metrics/logs/traces) on `dashboards` (Grafana, etc.)

In short: **Monitoring = Metrics** | **Logging = Events** | **Tracing = Flows**

# 🧠 Mental Model: Kubernetes Monitoring Layers

| Layer | What you're monitoring | Tools Used |
|:------|:------------------------|:-----------|
| **Cluster Infrastructure** | Nodes, Kubelets, API server, etcd | Prometheus, Node Exporter |
| **Kubernetes System** | Pods, Services, Deployments, Networking, Storage | kube-state-metrics, cAdvisor |
| **Application Layer** | Your app behavior and health | Prometheus SDK, Jaeger, Fluentd |
| **Logging** | Logs from containers and system | Fluentbit, Fluentd, Loki, EFK stack |
| **Tracing** | End-to-end request flow | Jaeger, OpenTelemetry |
| **Alerting & Visualization** | Dashboards and alerts | Grafana, Alertmanager |

# 🧩 Full Breakdown (in Deep Detail)

## 1. Metrics Collection

> "How is my cluster performing?"

### 📍 Important Metrics to Monitor:
- **Node Level**: CPU, memory, disk, network IO.
- **Pod/Container Level**: CPU/memory usage, restarts, uptime.
- **Service Level**: HTTP status codes, request latencies.
- **Cluster Health**: etcd database health, API Server availability.

### 🛠️ Key Tools:
- **Prometheus**:  
  - Open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit.
  - Pulls metrics via **HTTP endpoints** exposed by services.
  - Data stored in **time-series database**.
  - Language: **PromQL** for querying.
- **cAdvisor (Container Advisor)**:
  - Metrics collection at **container level**.
- **kube-state-metrics**:
  - Exposes **Kubernetes resource states** as metrics.
  - Example: number of pending pods, number of available replicas.

### 🧠 Basic Prometheus Setup in k8s:
- Install Prometheus using **Helm** chart or manually.
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from:
  - Node Exporter (for node metrics)
  - kubelet (/metrics endpoint)
  - Application endpoints (/metrics)

---

## 2. Logging

> "What happened in my cluster?"

### 📍 Logs to Watch:
- Pod stdout/stderr
- Node system logs
- Kubernetes component logs (kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-controller-manager)

### 🛠️ Key Tools:
- **EFK Stack** (Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana)
  - Fluentd: log collector.
  - Elasticsearch: log storage and search.
  - Kibana: visualization.
- **Loki**:
  - Lightweight, Prometheus-style logging.
  - Good integration with Grafana.
- **Fluentbit**:
  - Lightweight alternative to Fluentd.

### 🧠 Log Flow Architecture:
```
Container stdout/stderr → Fluentbit → Fluentd → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

OR for Loki:
```
Container logs → Fluentbit → Loki → Grafana
```

## 3. Tracing

> "Where is my request stuck?"

### 📍 When to use:
- Complex **microservices** architecture.
- Need to **trace a request path** across many services.

### 🛠️ Key Tools:
- **Jaeger**:
  - Distributed tracing system.
  - Captures spans and visualizes request flow.
- **OpenTelemetry**:
  - Standard way to collect traces, metrics, logs.
  - SDK available for most languages.

### 🧠 How Tracing Works:
1. App injects **trace id** into each request.
2. Trace id is passed to each service along the call chain.
3. Collector gathers spans → Backend like Jaeger stores and shows them.

---

## 4. Alerting

> "Alert me when something is wrong."

### 🛠️ Key Tools:
- **Prometheus Alertmanager**:
  - Defines alert rules.
  - Sends alerts via Slack, email, PagerDuty, etc.
- **Grafana Alerts**:
  - Alerts directly from dashboards.

### 🧠 Basic Alert Example:
```yaml
groups:
- name: node_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: NodeDown
    expr: up{job="node-exporter"} == 0
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Node down"
```

---

## 5. Visualization

> "Show me the system visually."

### 🛠️ Key Tools:
- **Grafana**:
  - World's most popular open-source dashboard tool.
  - Connects to Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, Elasticsearch, etc.

### 🧠 Grafana Best Practices:
- Set up **dashboards** for:
  - Node health
  - Pod status
  - App latency and error rates
  - Storage usage
- Use **annotations** to mark events (e.g., deployments).

# 📚 Deep Dive: Advanced Concepts

- **Service Mesh Observability**:  
  - Using Istio/Linkerd to collect traffic metrics and tracing automatically.
- **Custom Metrics**:  
  - Expose business-specific metrics from your apps (`/metrics` endpoint using Prometheus SDK).
- **Blackbox Monitoring**:  
  - Monitor **external endpoints** (HTTP, TCP) using Prometheus blackbox exporter.
- **Cluster Autoscaling Metrics**:  
  - HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) depends on metrics like CPU/memory/custom metrics.
- **Node Auto-healing**:  
  - Using alerts + automation to automatically reboot unhealthy nodes.

# 📋 Checklist for Setting Up K8s Monitoring Properly

✅ Metrics collection system (Prometheus + exporters)  
✅ Logging pipeline (Fluentbit/Fluentd + Loki/Elasticsearch)  
✅ Tracing (Jaeger or OpenTelemetry)  
✅ Alerting system (Alertmanager + alerts configured)  
✅ Visualization dashboards (Grafana + templates)  
✅ Auto-scaling based on real-time metrics  
✅ Security best practices (TLS, auth on monitoring systems)

# 🎯 Final Pro Tips:

- Always **instrument your applications** to expose metrics and traces.
- Monitor **costs**! Logging, metrics, tracing can be **very expensive** if not filtered/aggregated properly.
- Use **sampling** for traces (don't trace every request).
- Secure Prometheus, Grafana, etc., behind authentication.
- Don't wait for the crash — set **threshold-based proactive alerts**.
